                            <p>This article is about my opinion about the movie "Ford VS Ferrari" which is directed by James Mangold. Remember, this is not my review for a movie I'm just giving my opinion about this movie.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            As this movie is belongs to biography category. Firstly I watched it's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3h9Z89U9ZA">trailer</a>. From the trailer I feel like in the movie they are going to show us the battle between the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company">"Ford Motor Company"</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari">"Ferrari"</a>, I mean how the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company">"Ford Motor Company"</a> beats the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari">"Ferrari"</a> in the 1960's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_Hours_of_Le_Mans">Le Mans</a> race .
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            So as I starting watching movie, in the beginning of the movie Ferrari wons the race the car was driven by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carroll_Shelby">"Carroll Shelby"</a>. As in the mid 1960 Ford was very successful company in the market they make lots of their car sell each year but still their company name was not as much as that popular as compare to Ferrari. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford_II">Henry Ford II</a> as the president of the Ford Motor Company at that time. I came to company and told working to shut it down the company's production and go home, he also told workers that "Walk Home. While you're walking, I want you to ruminate. Man comes to my office with an idea, that man keeps his job. Rest of you second-best losers...stay home. You don't belong at Ford." The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Iacocca">Lee Iacocca</a> told Mr. Henry Ford II that we've been thinking wrong. Ferrari, now they won four out of last five Le Mans. We need to think like Ferrari. LEO said Ferrari makes fewer cars in a year than we make in a day. You want us to think like them? Iacocca said Enzo Ferrari will go down in history as the greatest car manufacturer of all time. LEO as why? Iacocca said Is because he made the most cars? No. It's because of what's his cars mean. Victory. Ferrari wins at Le Mans, People they, they want some of that victory. What if Ford badge meant victory? and volla here the main part started.</p>

<p> Some of the member from Ford went to Ferrari offices as they knew that Ferrari is bank corrupted. Lee Iacocca said this merger between our companies will form two entities. Ford-Ferrari 90% owned by Ford, who controls all production. Secondly, Ferrari-Ford the race team, 90% owned by ferrari. In order to secure this Ford will pay the some equivalent amount. The precident of Ferrari told that he need some time. But one journalist went to Fiat precident home and told him about this deal. Fiat precident said Enzo(Ferrari's Precident) maintains full control. I get the company for 18Million. Well now twist begins... Lee Iacocca went to Ferrari's office, then Owner of Ferrari said "If a wish to race Le Mans, and you do not wish for me to race Le Mans, do we or do we not go? Lee Iacocca said according to bond No, you do not go". Ferrari's President said " My integrity as a constructor , as a man, an a Italin, is deeply insulted by your proposal". Go back to Machigan, Back to your big ugly factory making it's big ugly, little cars. Tell your big headed boss that he is not Henry Ford, He's Henry Ford II with some harsh words. Why? This much of drama, because "FIAT BUYS FERRARI". All this things is now get understand by Mr.Henry Ford II. Mr.Henry Ford II get angry and said I want best enginners. The best drivers. I don't care what it costs. We're gonna build the race car and we're gonna bury that goddamn greasy wop 100 feet deep under the finish line at Le Mans. And I will be there to watch it.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Well Well battle is begins. Then Lee Iacocca went to Caroll Shelby, He told that Mr. Henry Ford II wanted his company to win the 24hours of Le Mans. You are only American that ever done it. Caroll Shelby said it's not about money its about the car, to win that race you need the car that's light enough to do 200 on the straightways but strong enough to keep that up for 3000 miles without a break. Not just the best car y'all ever made, but better than anything that Enzo ferrari shows up with that year. They made a deal and now Ford Motor company ready to go for Le Mans.
                            </p>

                            <p> At this point I feel that this movie totally based on Ford and Ferrari but as soon as I watch further movie it totally about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Miles">Ken Miles</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carroll_Shelby">Carolly Shelby</a> they made the Ford to wins at Le Mans in 1960. There is a point at 7000RPM where everything fades. The machine becomes weightless. Just disappear. To understand  meaning of this statement and How they won Le Man? To know it watch <a href="https://europixhd.net/mov/ford-v-ferrari-2019-online-free-hd-with-subtitles-europix">Ford Vs Ferrari</a>.</p>
