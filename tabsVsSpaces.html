										<h1>The Battle: Tabs Vs Spaces.</h1>
									</header>
									<p>
                    In the software industry, when an engineers about to start working on project, they have discuss lots of factor such as which language should we have to use for implement this project, if any selected then why it is? Why not others?, same about testing frameworks as there are many choices now-a-days for what you want to build. This problems can get solve after some hours of discussion, but programmers also talk about before writing a code as a indentor what should be get use, tabs or spaces?
									</p>
									<p>
                    As coder is also a human being, they can have habit of either of using a tabs or spaces. If you are entering into some organization they already have fixed their rules and regulation they fix about what they are strictly going to use spaces over tabs or tabs over spaces, if you belonging or confortable with that, it's your luck else either you have to change your habit or you could be kicked. There are some reasons why coder try to use one over other. But wait why does company follows the either tabs or spaces? Because as there are more than one contributor for a project, the  project code should be look like as it is written by a single person, and this is possible when each contributor follow the some certains rule which were decided by company/team before start working on project so as to code looks similar. The rule itself have many options, lets take example of a if statment in C => <br />
                    1) if (condition) { <br/>
                          // some statements <br/>
                       }<br /> <br />
                    
                    2) if (condition) <br />
                       {<br />
                          // some statement <br />
                       } <br />
                   
                   But today we are going to talk about only tabs and spaces.
									</p>
                  <span class="image">

                  </span>

                   There is always battle between tabs over spaces and spaces over tabs. <br /> <br />
                   <b>The point of view of tabs over spaces:</b> (I'm talking about one tab over 8 spaces <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation">Indentation</a>.) <br />
                        1) Why to press a key four time for the same work. Tab can achive the same indentaion by pressing a key only single time. Spaces are time consuming. <br />
                    2) One space takes 1bytes means eight spaces will take 8bytes, tabs takes just 1byte. Spaces increases the file size.<br /><br />
                    <b>The point of view of spaces over tabs:</b> <br />
                    1) Tabs may look different on other machines(people used tabstop=value), using space indentation code looks same on every machine. <br />

                    Let me tell you one story which it just clicked in my mind, it is from series Silicon Valley, Richard who is the CEO of Pied Piper company, he has a girlfriend. The problem is Richard was a tabs guy and his girlfriend was spaces guy. Richard's girlfriend doesn't know about the Richard is anti spaces guy but his friend told her. One day Richard's girlfriend invites him to her home, they start coding together. As Richard's girlfriend is uses spaces Richard feel like annoying, he try to manage it some minutes but as he was anti-spaces guy he finally told his girlfriend not to do this and they start fighting over it, they both breakup and the reason for breakup is one was uses spaces and other was tabs. Funny story isn't it? You can watch video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfEIkkDkrmE">Here</a>.
									</p>

                  <p>
                   Who am I? Tabs guys or spaces guys? Well I was also tabs guys. I also used to use tabs but now my vim editor convert those tabs into spaces. In today's world your editor will convert your tabs into spaces if you want to.
                  </p>
