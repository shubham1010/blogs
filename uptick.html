							<p><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_(TV_series)">Silicon Valley</li></a>This article about Silicon Valley's <a href="https://europixhd.io/tvs/siliconvalley/silicon-valley-season-3-hd-with-subtitles-europix">Season-3 Episode-10</a>.</p>
							<p>I have been watching this series since last near about 3-4months. I have completed the all season of it but still I love to watch them again. In this episode Richard (who is the CEO of <a href="http://www.piedpiper.com/">Pied Piper</a>) recognise that users those are using his application most of them are fake user according to their behaviour of interaction with an application. Jared (COO of the Pied Piper) he bought all those fake user because Richard was so disappointed due to lack of active user for their application. Richard even plan to shutdown his company due to lack of active user and no funds as well, So Jared brough fake users. Now fake user thing only know Richard and Jared from group of 5 peoples(Erlich Bachman, Bertram Gilfoyle, Dinesh Chugtai) including Richard and Jared. Erlich went to have his lunch and drink, when he returns home he was telling all peoples about as company is running low he made a deal with Coleman Blair Parterns basis of "The Uptick" i.e. suddenly increasing number of users but Erlich also dont know that they are fake ones. They are ready to pay they a Series B of round $6Million on $60 Million valuation.</p>
							<p>Now Dinesh and Gilfoyle also recognise about the fake user, they talk to Richard about fake user and they dont want to know more about it beacause of funding they got. They told Richard we dont want to hear anything you can move forward to take deal. But as on the basis of fake user talking a deal is crime so Richard and Jared had little conversation on what to do about the deal. They nigotiate and somehow Richard and Erlich went to take a deal. After meeting started Richard was so thinking about what to do, so Coleman Blair Parterns give agreements papers to Richard for signature. Richard stop and he was talking about the video chat application they are building, He was asking investors to invest their funds on that video chat application instead PipePiper. He force so much and then investor asked again and again why do you wanna do that? Why you wanna do that? and suddenly he spoke that as you are investing basis on "The Uptick" that is not "The Uptick" they are fake, most of them are fake users he told the truth and both Richard and Erlich went from an office. As Erlich didn't know about fake user he pissed off and he get very angry on Richard.</p>
						  	<p>Now PiedPiper is in dangeours state, they are now about to shrink. Due to so many dipression Erlich plan trip to Kahincha Dham Ashram in Nainital,India. Bachmanity[Erlich and Big Head(friend of Richard)] they are bussiness parterns. Revega the core investors of PiedPiper take an action to sold all IP's of PiedPiper. Gavin Belson (CEO of Hooli) is offer Laury (the head of Revega) $1Million for PiedPiper. Richard went to board meeting at Revega. Now the PiedPiper on the his way to get sold out. As Monica(works at Revega and invest some money into PiedPiper) and Richard are going to say No to Laury's decision about to sell PiedPiper to Gavin Belson. So as to be dominent 3 people needed to be vote as YES, as Monica from Revega's worker Laury assuming that she is going to say YES but Monica refused. So they other thing happen. Suddenly Richard thought that anyhow this company going to crash so somehow Richard said YES and Lauri got three YES now, so now PiedPiper, its IP and all of its assets are now officially the property of Bachmanity,LLC.</p>
							<P>Then Monica and Richard shocked they were assuming Lauri is selling PiedPier to Gavin Belson but Lauri sold it to Bachmanity. As Bachmanity is property of Erlich and Big-Head both of they are friends of Richard he is so happy that his hard work is not going to waste now. So eveyone are happy now and yes, that was happy ending.</P>
